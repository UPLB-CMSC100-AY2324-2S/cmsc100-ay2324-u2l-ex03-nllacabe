What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
My key takeaways from this exercise is that JavaScript is fun if not under time pressure. Hindi na po ako nagcram ngayon hehe.
It is similar to python in a way, which brings me back to my CMSC 12 days. However, I did not enjoy JavaScript back then unlike now because, like I said nga, of the constant time pressure sa labs.
Ngayon, aliw na aliw ako sa onti ng lines of code na ginamit ko kasi parang ngayon nalang po ulit to nangyari :D
